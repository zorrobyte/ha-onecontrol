# ha-onecontrol

Home Assistant HACS integration for OneControl BLE gateways (Lippert/LCI).

Connects directly to OneControl BLE gateways via the HA Bluetooth stack, authenticates using the TEA protocol, and creates native HA entities for RV device monitoring and control.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS

2. Install "OneControl"

3. Restart Home Assistant

4. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → OneControl

### Manual

Copy `custom\_components/onecontrol/` to your HA `config/custom\_components/` directory.

## Configuration

During setup, the integration discovers OneControl gateways via BLE advertisements. You will be asked to select your **gateway type** — check the physical hardware:

| Gateway type | How to identify |
| - | - |
| **Push-to-Pair** | Has a physical "Connect" button on the RV control panel |
| **PIN (legacy)** | No Connect button — uses only the 6-digit PIN sticker |


### Push-to-Pair gateways (newer)

1. Select **Push-to-Pair** when prompted

2. Press the physical Connect button on your RV control panel

3. Enter the 6-digit PIN from the gateway sticker

4. Works with both ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy and direct USB adapters

### PIN (legacy) gateways (older)

1. Select **PIN** when prompted

2. Enter the 6-digit PIN from the gateway sticker

3. **Before initial setup/pairing, temporarily disable ESPHome Bluetooth proxies** so Home Assistant is forced to pair through the host's internal/direct Bluetooth adapter

4. **Requires a direct USB Bluetooth adapter** — see [PIN Gateway Requirements](#pin-gateway-requirements) below

## PIN Gateway Requirements

Legacy PIN gateways use a BLE passkey exchange during bonding that requires direct access to the host's BlueZ Bluetooth stack.

### Direct USB Bluetooth adapter (supported)

The integration registers a BlueZ D-Bus agent that provides the passkey automatically during bonding. No manual steps required beyond entering the PIN in the config flow. This path is confirmed working.

**Compatible hardware:** the Raspberry Pi's built-in Bluetooth adapter, or any USB Bluetooth dongle recognized by the HA host. To extend range as much as possible, a USB adapter with an antenna is highly recommended.

### ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy (not supported for PIN gateways)

ESPHome proxies forward GATT operations but do not relay BLE passkey/pairing events back to the HA host. The passkey exchange must happen on the device with the BLE radio, which is the ESP32 — but the ESP32 has no way to receive the PIN from HA during a live pairing attempt.

**Push-to-Pair gateways work normally through ESPHome proxies.** Only PIN gateways are affected.

### Experimental: pre-bond the ESP32 to the gateway

It is possible to bond an ESP32 proxy device directly to the gateway before deploying it as a proxy. The bond is stored in the ESP32's NVS flash and survives OTA firmware updates (as long as flash is not erased). Once bonded, the proxy can connect to the gateway without a passkey exchange, and the integration handles application-layer authentication as normal.

This approach is experimental. If you are attempting this, use the `pairing\_test.yml` ESPHome configuration. Key requirements:

- Both the pairing helper firmware and the production proxy firmware must use the **Bluedroid** BLE stack (not NimBLE) — bond storage is not compatible between the two stacks

- Flash the pairing helper to the **exact device** that will serve as the proxy — bonds are not transferable between ESP32 units

- OTA-flash the production proxy firmware **without erasing flash** after bonding
## Supported Devices
